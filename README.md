
In this back-end project, I created contact management system from scratch, allowing users to securely create an account and login. To ensure seamless and authenticated interactions, I utilized JWT tokens for managing user sessions. By using Express.js, Node.js, and Mongoose, I developed CRUD functionalities for contacts, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete their contact information. The use of JWT tokens was crucial in validating and authorizing user actions, ensuring that only authenticated users could access and manipulate their own contact data. Additionally, stringent access controls were put in place to prevent unauthorized access, guaranteeing that other users could not read, update, or delete contact information belonging to others. With MongoDB as the underlying database, this solution offers a reliable and scalable storage mechanism for efficiently managing user and contact data. By integrating bcrypt for secure password hashing, this project prioritized data integrity and user privacy, exhibiting a strong dedication to reliable security procedures all the way through the development process.<br><br>
